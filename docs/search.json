    "text": "Data Acquisition and Dataset Construction (fetch_data.py)\nThis project includes a standalone script, fetch_data.py, which constructs the season-level hitter dataset used by the analysis module and Streamlit app. The script collects Statcast event-level data for the 2025 season, filters to home runs, aggregates hitter-level summaries, and merges in barrel statistics from a separate Baseball Savant leaderboard export. The final output is a single combined CSV used throughout the project.\n\nWhat the script produces\nRunning fetch_data.py creates the following files:\n\ndata/hr_distance_leaders_2025.csv\nPlayer-level home run summaries computed directly from Statcast event data (home run count, average/max distance, average/max exit velocity).\ndata/combined_leaders_2025.csv\nThe final analysis dataset containing the home run summaries merged with barrel metrics (barrels and barrel percentage).\n\n\n\nData sources\nThe dataset is assembled from two sources:\n\nEvent-level Statcast data via pybaseball\nThe script uses pybaseball.statcast() to collect pitch-by-pitch data for the 2025 season and filters to events == \"home_run\". This provides the raw inputs for home run distance and exit velocity metrics.\nBarrel leaderboard data from Baseball Savant\nBarrel totals and barrel percentage are imported from data/exit_velocity.csv, which is a leaderboard-style CSV downloaded from Baseball Savant.\n\n\n\nProcessing steps\nThe script follows these steps:\n\nPull Statcast data for the full season\n\nstatcast(start_dt=\"2025-03-20\", end_dt=\"2025-11-01\")\n\nFilter to home runs only\n\nhr = data[data[\"events\"] == \"home_run\"]\n\nAggregate to hitter-season level Grouping by hitter ID (batter), the script computes:\n\nhr_count: number of home runs\navg_hr_distance, max_hr_distance: mean and max of hit_distance_sc\navg_launch_speed, max_launch_speed: mean and max of launch_speed\n\nApply minimum sample size threshold\n\nOnly hitters with hr_count &gt;= 5 are kept.\n\nRound numeric columns for readability\n\nDistance and exit velocity are rounded to 1 decimal place.\n\nLoad and clean barrel leaderboard data\n\nThe leaderboard file exit_velocity.csv is loaded.\nA player_name field is created from the \"last_name, first_name\" column.\nOnly player_id, player_name, barrels, and brl_percent are retained.\n\nMerge datasets\n\nThe home run summary table is merged with the barrel table using IDs:\n\nleaders.batter matched to savant_barrels.player_id\n\nThe merge uses how=\"inner\" to keep only hitters present in both sources.\n\nFinalize columns and save\n\nColumns are ordered so that player_name appears first.\nThe final dataset is saved to data/combined_leaders_2025.csv.\n\n\n\n\nHow to run it\nFrom the repository root:\npython fetch_data.py"

    "section": "Data",
    "text": "Data\nThe data used in this project come from MLB Statcast hitter leader statistics for the 2025 regular season. Statcast is MLB’s advanced tracking system that records detailed information about every batted ball using radar and camera-based technology. This allows more advanced statistics to be examined like how hard a player hits the ball, how far it travels, and how consistently the player’s performance occurs over time.\nThe dataset was manually obtained by combining data from the pybaseball package with data obtained through the Baseball Savant website, the official host of Google Cloud statistics. The .csv files containing different statistics were then cleaned and merged into a final dataset, which was then used for all analyses. This dataset gives leaderboard-level summaries for various hitting metrics. The data were collected once and stored on GitHub to make sure the analyses are consistent and reproducible. The final cleaned dataset used throughout this project is saved as: combined_leaders_2025.csv. Each row in the dataset represents a hitter who appeared on at least one Statcast leaderboard during the 2025 season.\n\nVariables of Interest\nThe analysis looks at both peak performance and average performance so that one-off standout outcomes and overall consistency could be compared. The variables focused on are:\n\nHome run count (hr_count): Total number of home runs hit by a player during the season\nAverage home run distance (avg_hr_distance): Average distance(in feet) of a player’s home runs\nMax home run distance (max_hr_distance): Longest home run hit by the player\nAverage launch speed (avg_launch_speed): Average exit velocity (speed of the ball off the bat)\nMaximum launch speed (max_launch_speed): Maximum exit velocity recorded for the player\nBarrels (barrels): Number of “barrels” (batted balls hit with an optimal combination of speed and launch angle)\nBarrel percentage (brl_percent): Proportion of a player’s batted balls classified as barrels\n\nTogether, these variables represent different components of home run power like raw strength, quality of contact, and consistency of performance.\n\n\nData Preparation\nBefore analysis, the data were cleaned and filtered using custom Python functions created for this project. This included removing observations with missing values in key variables and filtering out players with less than five total home runs to reduce noise from small sample sizes. This ensured that when comparing hitters, meaningful patterns were found instead of isolated events."

    "text": "Methods\nOur workflow involved data collection, wrangling, analysis, and visualization. All steps were completed in Python and organized into reusable scripts and functions developed for this project.\n\nData Collection and Dataset Construction\nTo build the hitter dataset, we pulled pitch-by-pitch Statcast data for the full 2025 regular season using the pybaseball library. Because the focus of this project is on power and peak outcomes, the raw pitch-by-pitch data were filtered to include only home run events. These home run events were then aggregated to the player level. For each hitter, season-level summaries of home run totals, distance, and exit velocity were computed.\nNext, a second dataset containing barrel statistics was downloaded directly from the MLB website. To combine the two sources, we made a consistent player name field and kept only the variables needed for analysis (barrels and brl_percent). We then merged the two datasets using player identifiers by linking the Statcast-derived hitter table with the barrel dataset on player ID. The merger of these two datasets is the final analysis dataset we used throughout the project: combined_leaders_2025.csv.\n\n\nSummary Tables\nTo assist us in answering our research question, we created several summary tables:\n\nLongest vs. average home run distance: We ranked hitters by maximum home run distance and reported each player’s average home run distance along with supporting context like home run totals and exit velocity metrics.\nBarrel and power indicators: We ranked hitters by barrel percentage and reported related power variables such as home run distance and exit velocity metrics to compare quality of contact profiles across hitters.\nWorkload vs. performance: We examined the relationship between workload (hr_count) and performance (avg_hr_distance) to explore whether players with more home runs also tend to hit longer home runs on average.\n\n\n\nCorrelation Analysis\nIn order to analyze relationships among key power metrics, we computed a Pearson correlation matrix across distance, exit velocity, barrels, barrel percentage, and home run totals. This allows for a high-level view of which metrics tend to move together and which capture different components of home run power.\n\n\nOutlier Detection\nA central part of our question was extreme performances so we identified standout hitters using an outlier method. For the selected metrics a z-score was calculated. When a hitter had a value more than 2.5 standard deviations from the mean they were flagged. These players were not treated as data errors, but instead used to highlight potential examples of exceptional peak performance. This allowed us to assess whether these extremes were supported by strong average metrics.\n\n\nVisualization\nFinally, we used scatter plots to visualize the relationships between maximums and averages. These included:\n\nmax vs. average home run distance\nexit velocity vs average home run distance\nbarrel percentage vs. average home run distance\nhome run count vs average home run distance\n\nThese visualizations help to show trends, clusters, and potential standout hitters that might not be immediately recognizable from “Top 5” tables alone."

    "section": "Discussion",
    "text": "Discussion\nThe goal of this project was to examine whether hitters who appear as leaders in Statcast maximum metrics also tend to perform well on average, or whether these leaderboard-topping values often reflect isolated events. Overall, the results suggest that while maximum metrics are related to average performance, they do not fully reflect a hitter’s consistency over the course of a season.\nAcross multiple visualizations, maximum home run distance showed a positive but imperfect relationship with average home run distance. Several hitters recorded extremely long individual home runs without ranking as highly in average distance, indicating that peak power alone does not guarantee sustained production. This supports the idea that maximum Statcast values, while attention-grabbing, can sometimes overstate a player’s typical performance.\nIn contrast, metrics tied more closely to repeatable contact quality—such as average exit velocity and barrel percentage—showed clearer and more stable associations with average home run distance. Hitters with higher barrel rates and stronger average exit velocity tended to cluster at higher average distances, suggesting that these metrics better reflect consistent power output rather than one-off extremes.\nThe relationship between home run workload and average distance further highlights the diversity of power profiles among hitters. While many high–home run hitters also maintained strong average distances, the variability in this relationship suggests that volume alone does not explain differences in power consistency. Some hitters appear to rely on frequent but less extreme power, while others produce fewer but more impactful contact events.\nSeveral limitations of this analysis should be noted. First, the threshold for what constitutes a home run varies by stadium. Some ballparks are known to be very hitter-friendly while others are known to be more difficult. A batter from a team that plays all of their home games in a shallow field will accumulate more home runs than a batter of equal skill that plays elsewhere. Another caveat is that the number of home runs is not the only important batting statistic. There are potentially many excellent players that are excluded from this analysis due to their focus on contact hitting. Thus it is important to note that players in this analysis are not necessarily the “best” players, and batters not in this analysis are not necessarily worse players.\nFuture work could add meaningfully to this analysis in several ways. Examining multiple seasons would help determine whether the observed relationships are stable over time or driven by year-specific effects. Incorporating additional Statcast variables such as launch angle distributions or plate appearance totals could provide a more complete picture of consistency. Finally, modeling variability directly, for example, through measures of dispersion rather than simple averages, could further distinguish between hitters who produce consistent power and those driven by rare peak events."
