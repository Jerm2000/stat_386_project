## Overview

This project analyzes **MLB Statcast hitting leaders** from the 2025 season.  
Our goal is to understand different aspects of **home run power**—a player's ability to hit the ball **hard** and **far**—using Statcast performance metrics.

We built a Python analysis package and an interactive Streamlit app that allow users to explore relationships between hitting variables such as home run distance, exit velocity, and barrel rate.

## Data Description

We use a cleaned dataset saved as: `data/combined_leaders_2025.csv`

Each row represents a hitter. Important variables include:

- **`hr_count`** – number of home runs hit  
- **`avg_hr_distance`** – average distance (in feet) of a player's home runs  
- **`max_hr_distance`** – longest home run the player hit  
- **`avg_launch_speed`** – average exit velocity (speed of the ball off the bat)  
- **`max_launch_speed`** – maximum exit velocity recorded  
- **`barrels`** – count of “barrels,” (batted balls hit both **hard** and at **ideal launch angles**) 

- **`brl_percent`** – barrel percentage (barrels divided by all batted balls)

These metrics capture different components of hitting performance and power.

## Package & Analysis Functions

The `analysis.py` module includes functions for:

- loading and preparing the dataset  
- summarizing longest vs average home run distance  
- calculating correlations between metrics  
- ranking players by barrel rate  
- examining workload vs performance  
- detecting outliers  
- producing scatterplots for all major relationships  

Examples of how to use these functions appear on the **Tutorial** page.

## Streamlit App

We built a Streamlit dashboard to visualize hitter performance interactively.  
Users can:

- filter hitters by minimum home runs  
- explore longest HR distances  
- examine correlations  
- visualize relationships between power metrics  
- view statistical standouts  

Run locally with:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit.py
```
or by following [this link to the streamlit app](https://cjecma74qyqcmmncdzbtfv.streamlit.app).
